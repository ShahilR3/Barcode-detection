# Barcode-detection

Barcode detection technology has emerged as a robust solution for authorization processes,
revolutionizing security measures across various domains, including retail, access control,
and identification systems. This abstract explores the advancements in barcode detection
algorithms and their applications in enhancing both security and efficiency in authorization
procedures. The research covers a number of important topics, including feature extraction,
classification, and data preprocessing. Additionally, several barcode kinds are taken into
account, including two-dimensional (2D) barcodes like QR codes and one-dimensional (1D)
barcodes like UPC and EAN. The system is built to effectively handle a variety of barcode
variations, orientations, sizes, and scanning situations, producing trustworthy results even
in difficult circumstances. There are many benefits to implementing the suggested barcode
detecting system. It vastly enhances the whole authorisation process' speed and accuracy,
lowering manual errors and boosting operational effectiveness. Additionally, by validating
and authenticating people, things, or access credentials, the system improves security
measures by taking advantage of barcodes' capacity for unique identification.
